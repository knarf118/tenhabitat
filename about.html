        For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track
        of time. The current sexagesimal system of time measurement dates to
        approximately 2000 BC from the Sumerians. The Egyptians divided the day
        into two 12-hour periods, and used large obelisks to track the movement
        of the sun. They also developed water clocks, which were probably first
        used in the Precinct of Amun-Re, and later outside Egypt as well; they
        were employed frequently by the Ancient Greeks, who called them
        clepsydrae. The Zhou dynasty is believed to have used the outflow water
        clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from
        Mesopotamia as early as 2000 BC. Other ancient timekeeping devices
        include the candle clock, used in ancient China, ancient Japan, England
        and Mesopotamia; the timestick, widely used in India and Tibet, as well
        as some parts of Europe; and the hourglass, which functioned similarly
        to a water clock. The sundial, another early clock, relies on shadows to
        provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day. It is not so useful
        in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons
        change (if the gnomon was not aligned with the Earth's axis).
